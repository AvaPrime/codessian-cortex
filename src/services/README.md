# Services Module

This directory contains service classes that handle external integrations, data access, and business service orchestration for the Codessian Cortex project.

## Structure

- External API integrations
- Database access services
- Third-party service wrappers
- Business service orchestration
- Service interfaces and implementations

## Guidelines

- Implement dependency injection where appropriate
- Handle external service failures gracefully
- Implement proper logging and monitoring
- Follow interface segregation principle
- Keep services focused and cohesive

## Getting Started

Create service classes that encapsulate external dependencies and complex business operations. Each service should have clear interfaces and comprehensive error handling.
