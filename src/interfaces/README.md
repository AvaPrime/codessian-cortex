# Interfaces Module

This directory contains interface definitions, contracts, and abstraction layers for the Codessian Cortex project.

## Structure

- Interface definitions and contracts
- Abstract base classes
- Protocol definitions
- API contract specifications
- External system interfaces

## Guidelines

- Define clear and minimal interfaces
- Use dependency inversion principle
- Keep interfaces stable and versioned
- Document interface contracts thoroughly
- Avoid interface bloat and keep them focused

## Getting Started

Define interfaces that establish contracts between different parts of the system. These should be stable abstractions that allow for flexible implementations and easy testing.
